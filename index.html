            "That sounds like an interesting project. I only take on paid commissions at this stage of my career, but I appreciate you thinking of me.",
            "Thanks for reaching out. I'm not able to take on unpaid projects right now, but I'd love to chat if a budget opens up later this year.",

            "I appreciate you reaching out. While I love the concept, I’m not able to take on any unpaid work at this stage of my business.",

            "Thanks for thinking of me. I make it a point to only accept paid engagements to maintain my business sustainability, so I must decline.",
            "Thank you for thinking of me. This isn’t a fit for my current business model as I’m focusing on paid contracts, but I wish you the best of luck.",
